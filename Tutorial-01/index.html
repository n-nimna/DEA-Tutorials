Q1) What is a Servlet in Java?

The core of dynamic web applications is a Java Servlet, which may handle a number of functions, such as processing client-sent explicit and implicit data.
To satisfy the client's request, the servlet carefully parses and processes explicit data, such as form submissions. Furthermore, implicit data that 
is contained in request headers is extracted and used as needed for server-side operations. The servlet produces the required output after processing is finished, 
usually as HTML content. Ultimately, the client receives back both the implicit data and the processed explicit data (which are frequently displayed in HTML answers), 
guaranteeing a smooth communication between the client's web browser and the server. Because of Servlets' extensive functionality, 
dynamic and interactive websites may be created.


Q2) What is meant by static and dynamic websites. List down their differences.

1)	Static Website: 

Fixed material, which is what makes up static websites, is content that doesn't change for any user or request.
Static websites often use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to write their content. 
These websites can be developed more quickly and easily. 
The HTML files must be manually edited in order to update static webpages. 
They work well for websites like personal blogs or business websites whose content doesn't change often.

* Fixed Content
* Easier & Quicker Development
* Limited interactivity
* Manual editing of HTML files
* Content that doesnâ€™t change often

2)	Dynamic Websites:

Content on dynamic websites is created dynamically, meaning it can alter in response to user input, database queries, and other factors. 
Dynamic websites frequently use databases to store their content, which is then created using server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby.
Users of dynamic websites can receive individualized material according to their activities or interests. 
A content management system (CMS) or direct database modifications can be used to update dynamic webpages. 
These work well for websites that change their content often, such news, social networking, or e-commerce sites.

* Dynamically generated Content
* More Complex server-side scripting
* Can provide 
* Update through CMS or database
* Content that changes frequently

Security	            Less secure	      More secure


Q4)The web.xml file, also known as the Deployment Descriptor, 
is a configuration file used in Java Servlet-based web applications deployed on servlet containers like Apache Tomcat, Jetty, or others. Its primary purpose is to define configuration settings and mappings for servlets, filters, listeners, 
and other web components within the web application.
